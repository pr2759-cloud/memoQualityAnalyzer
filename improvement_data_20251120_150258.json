Prioritize actionable insights over comprehensive coverage.",
  "improvements_list": "1. **Added mandatory financial metrics requirements for Executive Summary** - Explicitly requires valuation, funding amounts, and revenue figures to prevent generic summaries that lack investment-relevant data.\n\n2. **Included concrete technical depth requirements for Product & Technology** - Added specific examples of good vs. bad descriptions and mandated performance benchmarks, API specs, and architecture details to prevent high-level generic content.\n\n3. **Made pricing and unit economics mandatory for Business Model** - Required specific pricing tiers, CAC, LTV, and revenue breakdown with explicit instruction to state unavailability rather than omit, addressing the most problematic section.\n\n4. **Added funding stage verification to prevent classification errors** - Included specific instruction to cross-reference funding claims to avoid misclassifying mature companies as seed-stage.\n\n5. **Implemented quality checkpoints and sourcing requirements** - Added measurable quality checks for each section and required sourcing of quantitative claims to ensure data-backed analysis.\n\n6. **Enhanced competitive analysis with specific comparison metrics** - Required head-to-head win/loss rates and customer switching patterns to move beyond generic competitor lists.\n\n7. **Added good vs. bad examples for weakest sections** - Provided concrete examples showing the difference between generic and specific content for Product & Technology and Business Model sections.",
  "expected_impact": "These improvements should increase memo quality from 4.5/10 to 7-8/10 by ensuring each memo contains actionable, data-driven insights rather than generic research content. The mandatory requirements and quality checkpoints will prevent the most common failures (missing financial data, generic technical descriptions, absent pricing information), while the sourcing requirements will increase credibility and usefulness for investment decision-making. The specific examples will guide the AI toward producing investment-grade analysis that VCs can actually use for deal evaluation."
