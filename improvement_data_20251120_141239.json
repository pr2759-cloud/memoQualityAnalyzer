  "improvements_list": "1. **Added mandatory financial metrics and funding verification**: Executive Summary and Company Overview now require specific valuation, funding amounts, and stage verification to prevent factual errors about company maturity and scale.\n\n2. **Introduced technical depth requirements with examples**: Product & Technology section now demands specific technical details, performance benchmarks, and architecture information, with good/bad examples to guide output quality.\n\n3. **Made business model section actionable with pricing mandates**: Required exact pricing information, unit economics, and revenue breakdowns with specific instruction on how to handle missing data as due diligence gaps.\n\n4. **Added quantified competitive analysis requirements**: Competitive section now requires win/loss rates, pricing comparisons, and market share data rather than generic positioning statements.\n\n5. **Implemented quality checkpoints and sourcing standards**: Each section has specific verification requirements and sourcing standards to ensure claims are backed by data and confidence levels are stated.\n\n6. **Enhanced investment thesis with measurable predictions**: Investment thesis must now include specific outcome predictions and measurable milestones rather than generic potential assessments.\n\n7. **Added language precision requirements**: Eliminated generic descriptors in favor of quantified, sourced claims with specific company names and actual quotes.",
  "expected_impact": "These improvements should increase memo quality scores from 4.5/10 to 7-8/10 by addressing the core issues: lack of financial specificity, missing technical depth, absent pricing information, and generic competitive analysis. The mandatory verification requirements will prevent factual errors about funding stages, while the quantified requirements and quality checkpoints will ensure memos contain actionable investment data rather than high-level research summaries. The sourcing requirements will build confidence in claims and clearly identify due diligence gaps for follow-up investigation."
